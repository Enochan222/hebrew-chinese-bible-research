## 2026-10-03 — Sacred Studies method parity + mandatory push governance

### Push intent

Make the Hebrew-Bible research database use the full Sacred Studies scholarly-search/research method while correcting defects, and make project state/version history mandatory on every future push.

### Why

Two risks were identified:

1. `Sacred Studies-style` had been documented mainly as a provider-aggregation concept, without fully pinning the exact query/search/dossier/synthesis/review method.
2. Product intent and architecture were well documented, but there was no mechanically enforced rule requiring every push to update a living repository-state record and a human-readable reasoned change history.

### What changed

- added `architecture/sacred-studies-research-method.md`;
- added `contracts/v1.1/scholarly-research-method.json`;
- defined Text × Topic × Lens search matrix;
- preserved concise English academic-query generation, standard English book naming, and 3-6 term/phrase query design;
- preserved all-era + modern scholarship search policy, replacing stale 2015-2025 hard-coding with a rolling recent window;
- preserved academic-source prioritization and zero-hallucination bibliography rule;
- preserved Librarian dossier -> synthesis -> critical review/revision loop;
- preserved 88/100 review threshold and maximum three attempts;
- corrected Sacred Studies defects: invalid review output cannot auto-pass; provider failure cannot fall back to model-memory evidence;
- documented that current Sacred Studies provider helper wiring is incomplete and therefore is not copied literally;
- added `PROJECT_STATE.md` as mandatory living repository state;
- added `CHANGELOG.md` as mandatory reasoned push history;
- added `AGENTS.md` with read-before-change and update-before-push rules;
- added GitHub Actions governance check requiring every push/PR to modify both `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`;
- updated README, charter, manifest, discovery architecture, and contract validator to point to/enforce the new method/governance.

### Intended effect

Any future GPT/Codex/Gemini/developer build should be able to reconstruct both the product's current state and the exact scholarly search method without relying on chat history. No future push should silently change architecture without also updating project state and explaining why.

### Validation

- project-governance workflow introduced in this push;
- contract validator extended to verify Sacred Studies-derived method parameters;
- existing Core and Research Pro OpenAPI validation remains required;
- post-push GitHub Actions result is the authoritative execution record.
